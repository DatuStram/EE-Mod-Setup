[Description]
Mod-EN=Nathaniel Aplin-Fletcher is a former officer of the Flaming Fist. Although he is an experienced fighter, Nathaniel suffers from selfdoubts, possibly because of his lack of ruggedness. For some players he can become a loyal companion. For the right male character a friendship can develop to more.
